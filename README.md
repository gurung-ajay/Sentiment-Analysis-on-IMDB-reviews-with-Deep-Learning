# Sentiment-Analysis-on-IMDB-reviews-with-Deep-Learning
In this project, I built Deep Learning models for Sentiment analysis with Simple Neural Network and LSTM. These models couldnâ€™t capture the complexity of text data and were underfit. To solve this problem, I used Bidirectional LSTM which got training accuracy of 75.35% and validation accuracy of 76.03% on first epoch which improved to 91.62% and 87.25% respectively on final epoch.

Tools Used: Python, Tensorflow, Pandas and Matplotlib
