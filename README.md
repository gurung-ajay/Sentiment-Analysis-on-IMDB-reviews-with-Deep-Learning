# Sentiment-Analysis-on-IMDB-reviews-with-Deep-Learning
In this project, I built Deep Learning models that trains on data about IMDB reviews which are classified as positive or negative.
* Simple Neural Network
* LSTM
* Bidirectional LSTM

Out of them, Simple Neural Network model and LSTM model weren't able to learn from the dataset. Finially, the Bidirectional LSTM was able to learn and perform well on the training and validation data.
